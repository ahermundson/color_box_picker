#Color Box Picker

This app will:
* Shuffle an array of colors and choose the first 7 colors then display divs with that color as it's background color.
* Randomly select one of those colors as the target color
* If the user selects the right color they will receive a success message
* If the user selects the incorrect color the div they selected will shake and they will receive an incorrect notification
* After the user selects the correct color they have an opportunity to click a button to play the game again which will reshuffle the array and select a new color to pick.
